# Getting Started

This repository comes with some nice extras like testing, documentation and CI, but in it's heart it's just an HTML/CSS/JS website boilerplate.

## Development

To run this project locally you will need to open `index.html` in your browser using a local server. LiveServer, `http-server`, `study-lenses`, or any other local static server will work.

## Installing Dependencies

There are no dependencies needed to run the website, everything is prepared to work with vanilla JavaScript. However, if you want to install prettier for this project then run (generally you always want to do this if you see a `package.json` file):

- `npm install`

## Starter files

You will notice some starter code. This is a suggestion, but feel free to change what you want to, this is your project after all!

## Documentation

To document your project you will need to write a JSDoc comment for each function in the /handlers, /listeners and /logic. You will also want to add an entry to the JSDoc in /data.js for each property you store in the object.

The JSDoc comments you write in the /src folder will be used to re-write the DOCS.md file each time you run npm run document from the root of your project.

# Backlog

So what should be built? Below is a collection of user stories you can choose from. Stories inside of each priority level are not necessarily in order, it's up to your group to decide how they fit into your strategy. These are also just suggestion, feel free to change them or create your own! Feel free to get creative.
